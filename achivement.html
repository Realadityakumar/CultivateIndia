                1.1 Agriculture, Economy and population between 1951 and 2021 
            </h4>
            <p>India’s journey from 1950-51 to 2021-22 has been marked by significant growth. The population surged from 35.9 crore to 136.9 crore. Remarkably, food production outpaced this, increasing from 106 million tonnes to 936 million tonnes. The agriculture sector’s income saw a 7.27-fold increase, reflecting the sector’s resilience and growth. However, the non-agricultural sector outperformed with the national income rising 28.44 times. The workforce in agriculture expanded from 9.72 crore to 24.67 crore. These figures highlight India’s economic transformation over seven decades, underlining the pivotal role of both the agricultural and non-agricultural sectors in this journey. The data underscores the importance of continuous innovation and policy support in ensuring sustainable growth in the future.</p>

            <h4 class="text-xl font-bold">1.4 Achievement in food production</h4>
            <p></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Initial Years Post-Independence: Food production was sufficient to supply 0.81 kg of food per person per day or 296 kg per year.</li>
                <li>Green Revolution Impact: Per capita food production increased to 1.258 kg/person/day or 459 kg/year around 2000-01.</li>
                <li>21st Century Acceleration: A 50% increase in per capita food production was recorded in less than 25 years, marking a significant departure from the trend growth rate of the first 50 years after Independence.</li>
                <li>Future Projections: The next 50% increase in per capita food production is likely to be achieved in less than 25 years5.</li>

                <li>Demand-Driven Performance: States that have adapted their crop patterns to changing demand perform better than those with rigid crop patterns.</li>
                <li>Irrigation and Productivity: States leading in land productivity have lower irrigation coverage compared to states like Punjab and Haryana, suggesting that factors other than irrigation contribute to high productivity.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>Initial Variability: Initially, there was no clear trend in net trade, with exports and imports fluctuating due to domestic production instability and inward-looking trade policies.</li>
                <li>Post-1990 Growth: Since 1990, exports have consistently exceeded imports, driven by steady agriculture production growth, slowing population growth, and liberalization of trade policies.</li>
                <li>Export Increase: The fraction of output exported by India increased from 2.80% in the early 1990s to 6.98% in 2020-21.</li>
